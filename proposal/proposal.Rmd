### Workshops for Women

 - Workshops for women will re-use existing material contributed by Hadley, based on Master R Developer workshops (second day only). This will be made available to members of Forwards taskforce and others from the R Community for the sole purpose of running workshops targeted at under-represented groups [must be free to participants? Tutors must be volunteers?]. Hadley maintains copyright and full ownership of the materials.
 - Tutors agree to donate their time, but expenses are covered. As course material is already prepared, volunteer time is restricted to the workshop itself.
 - 3 workshops will be run, in NZ, US and EU, to tie in with R/statistical computing/statistics conferences that tutors already plan to attend. In this way no travel funding is required for tutors and the potential audience is maximised, with many attendees able to justify funding travel to both workshop and conference.
 - Therefore only expenses are additional night(s) accommodation of tutors and per diem for travel and subsistence; tea/coffee breaks and lunch for all participants. Additional funding is included to contribute to travel/accommodation expenses for people that need additional financial support.

### Workshops for Girls

 - Girl's workshop will be run on same principle, but new material needs to be developed for this, which will be developed by Di/Hadley/Jenny. Part of the funding will go to this. Afterwards material will be made available to members of Forwards taskforce and others from the R Community for the sole purpose of running similar outreach events [similar conditions as above].
 - It is assumed in this case, groups of girls will travel up for the day at low cost (e.g. coach travel) so can self-fund as a usual school trip.
